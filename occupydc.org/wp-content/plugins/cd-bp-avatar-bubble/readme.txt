After moving your mouse pointer on a BuddyPress user avatar (or clicking) you will see a bubble with selected by admin information about this user.

== Description ==

After moving your mouse pointer on a BuddyPress user avatar (or clicking it) you will see a bubble with selected by admin information about this user. 

Ajax calls save your bandwidth and time spent on waiting. So if you want your users can easily get information about themselves on a fly - use CD BP Avatar Bubble.

This plugin wouldn't exist without [Marco](http://teethgrinder.net) suggestion. His idea - my realization. Have a plugin idea or suggestion? Contact me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/slaFFik). 

I also want to thank my testers: [ZigZag](http://racingmag.ru/), [Альберт](http://sultan.ufalavka.ru/), [Sarah](http://wpmu.org/) and others.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it really use ajax for data-calls? =

Yes, it does. No need to wait until page will be loaded.


= Why doesn't this plugin work on my site? =

Are you using it on a live site? If not, there might be problems, because I didn't tested in Denwer, WAMP or LAMP. Try it live.
Try to reinstall the plugin too.
