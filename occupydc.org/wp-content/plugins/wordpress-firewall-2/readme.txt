This WordPress plugin monitors web requests to identify and stop the most obvious attacks.

== Description ==

This is an updated version of the popular *WordPress Firewall* plugin, with fixes for all known bugs and a few new features!

This WordPress plugin investigates web requests with simple, WordPress-specific heuristics, to identify and stop the most obvious attacks. There are a few powerful, generic modules that do this; but they're not always installed on web servers, and usually difficult to configure.

This plugin intelligently whitelists and blacklists pathological-looking phrases, based on which field they appear within, in a page request (unknown/numeric parameters vs. known post bodies, comment bodies, etc.). Its purpose is not to replace prompt and responsible upgrading, but rather to mitigate 0-day attacks and let bloggers sleep better at night.

Originally developed by SEO Egghead and released as *WordPress Firewall*.
