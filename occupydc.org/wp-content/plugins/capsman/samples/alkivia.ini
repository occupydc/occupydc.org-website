; If you set this file on your wp-content directory, it will override the plugin
; options, force to use this ones and disable them from the admin page.

; All alkivia plugins and themes share the same file. If you already have an 
; alkivia.ini file in your wp-content directory, you can copy and paste this 
; settings on it.

; The ini file is mostly used on WordPress MU, when we want to force all blogs to 
; this settings and don't want to allow the blog administrators to change them.
