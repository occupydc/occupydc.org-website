				<h1>Fourth GA Meeting, 10/2/11, 6:00 p.m.</h1>
<p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> Philip<br />
<strong>Assistant Facilitator:</strong> Caty</p>
<p><strong>First Agenda Item: Status update</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda Item 3: Storing our nonperishable’s, food, signs, etc overnight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>nearby organization will let us store them there tonight</li>
<li>working on finding a dedicated place</li>
</ul>
<p>Agenda Item 4: March debrief from Ali</p>
<ul>
<li>Marched to White House, circled back past AFL-CIO, who have pledged support; got lots of tourist attention, of passed out fliers.</li>
<li>Wall Street group marches at 9 a.m. and 4:30 pm, for opening and closing bell; suggested we coordinate times in solidarity with them and other occupy groups – some consensus
<ul>
<li>Point is made that the 6:00 hour is when most lobbyists, interns, House and Senate, etc leave work, so maybe we should march during their rush hour.</li>
<li>Motion is made to march at 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., could change if needed – <strong>approved.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suggestion is made to march to IMF.</li>
<li>Suggestion is made to march on K St rather than to White House.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda Item 5: Announcement from Nicole</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has extensive experience with collecting detailed information about money in politics (campaign finance, etc)</li>
<li>Can do a variety of educational work with anyone interested (teach-in, walking tours, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, recommendation is made that that kind of information would be good flier material – who we are, GA times, links to information sources for occupy movements, and a couple very strong statistics – general agreement</p>
<p>-Proposal is made that we form some kind of group to work on messaging</p>
<p>&#8211;Counter is made that we should continue to avoid too much bureaucratic organization; we all should participate in processes like messaging</p>
<p>&#8212;Facilitator proposes we come back to this conversation during our allotted 30 minute block at the end of the meeting – <strong>approved</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda Item 6: Announcement from Jim</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a couple hundred more people may be coming around noon on Tuesday</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> On that note, a suggestion is made that we hold morning GA at 11:00 a.m. rather than noon, so we can use lunchtime as an outreach opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>-point is raised that if we meet at noon, those of us who work in the area can come on lunch breaks</p>
<p>-suggestion is made that we could hold GA meetings after marches</p>
<p>&#8211;suggestion is made we hold them at 8:00 p.m. so that more people can attend</p>
<p>&#8212;concern that 8:00 is too late to start a meeting</p>
<p><em>&#8212;comments in favor of various meeting times and march times are made&#8212;-</em></p>
<p>&#8212;-Assistant facilitator proposes that in the interest of simplicity the group first either approve or reject the idea to meet after marches – approve</p>
<p>&#8212;Assistant facilitator proposes that we second decide between a 5:00, 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. march time</p>
<p>-proposal to march at 5:00 p.m., hold GA at 6 p.m. – <strong>approved</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Agenda Item 7: 30-minute messaging conversation</strong></p>
<p>-idea: we’re here for the 99%, and it should be that simple</p>
<p>&#8211;idea: we should keep in mind that many of us are here because we can be, and that we stand for people who can’t be</p>
<p>-idea: take the Wall Street list as a starting point, go from there; no reason to start from scratch and spend time going back and forth on things for which there’s already a framework from which to work</p>
<p>&#8211;idea: all occupy cities are unique and each group’s more specific focuses reflect that; politics are in DC, we could work with preexisting ideas but gear them toward political issues</p>
<p>&#8212;counterpoint is raised that Wall Street’s list came from many days of work; we should respect that process and have the experience of going through it ourselves</p>
<p>Assistant facilitator gave 10-minute notice to facilitator; facilitator proposes we address an issue raised earlier, that had general, unofficial consensus, about having a cycle of facilitators at each GA; proposes any interested parties can talk after the GA – approved</p>
<p><em>Meeting adjourned</em></p>

				<p><em>This was unanimously voted on by all members of Occupy Wall Street last night, around 8pm, Sept 29. It is our first official document for release. We have three more underway, that will likely be released in the upcoming days: 1) A declaration of demands. 2) Principles of Solidarity 3) Documentation on how to form your own Direct Democracy Occupation Group.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together. We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies.</p>
<p>As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known.</p>
<p>They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.</p>
<p>They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.</p>
<p>They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals, and actively hide these practices.</p>
<p>They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.</p>
<p>They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.</p>
<p>They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.</p>
<p>They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.</p>
<p>They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.</p>
<p>They have sold our privacy as a commodity.</p>
<p>They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press.</p>
<p>They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.</p>
<p>They have donated large sums of money to politicians supposed to be regulating them.</p>
<p>They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.</p>
<p>They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantive profit.</p>
<p>They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.</p>
<p>They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.</p>
<p>They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.</p>
<p>They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts.*</p>
<p>To the people of the world,</p>
<p>We, the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, urge you to assert your power.</p>
<p>Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>To all communities that take action and form groups in the spirit of direct democracy, we offer support, documentation, and all of the resources at our disposal.</p>
<p>Join us and make your voices heard!</p>
<p>*These grievances are not all-inclusive.</p></blockquote>

<li>Idea: this is a movement about fairness for all, compassion for all.</li>
<li>Idea: there is a sense of misery, fear, and powerlessness; this movement is about providing a space for us all to come together and discuss the issues behind that fear.</li>
<li>Idea: we should identify common grievances rather than agree on common demands.</li>
<li>Idea: this movement is about spreading the message that we’re the first generation since WWII to have it worse than our parents; we’re scared and we need help from the 99 percent.</li>
<li>Idea: we shouldn’t agree on a set list of goals right now because we don’t want to alienate anyone who could come later; let’s not take away their agency the way ours has been taken from us.</li>
<li>Idea: we should focus on conversations for now, get to know each other, feel out how we all feel, let our unified message grow organically.</li>
<li>Idea: we can control/unify our message by having a general consensus about the problem and making our<em> </em>own media, each person can express their own specific views.</li>
<li><em>Facilitator proposes that what he’s hearing is we all want a general consensus on grievances but we don’t want to box ourselves in by getting too specific.</em></li>
<li>Idea: stick with other occupy movements and stand with them on their unified messaging.</li>
<li>Idea: rather than say we’re mad about income inequality per se, say we’re mad about the power that is bestowed upon those with money; we want to separate political progress from profit.</li>
<li>Idea: we need to define what the phrase “We are the 99%” means</li>
<li>Idea: we need to stop worrying about coming up with a unified message for the benefit of the media, because they’re going to say whatever they say no matter what; we need to worry about coming up with a unified message for the benefit of people on the street, for the purpose of recruiting more people to join us.</li>
<li><em>Facilitator announces that 30 minutes are up, proposes we continue at tomorrow’s GA – <strong>approved</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>GA adjourned</em></p>

				<p>While many of us are sleeping in our comfy beds tonight, a handful of brave protestors are sleeping outside to Occupy DC! They have been supplied with warm blankets, foods, and rain gear but have moved out of the McPherson Square and found a dry doorway. I would urge everybody to give them warm coffee, chocolate milk, and food tomorrow morning because its freezing and wet outside. Here is a short video supplied by imnottouchingyou (IRC).</p>

				<p>I was at McPherson Square between 12pm and 5:15pm (had to leave the General Assembly) but would like to tell the world that everything is going great. Although we had a rainy and windy cold day we have seen people come and go and some media attention. We had tons of art supplies, made dozens of signs, had pizza, coffee, bread, and lots of interesting and dedicated people.  When I left at 5:15 I roughly counted between 115 and 135 people at the General Assembly, but we definitely had a lot more people over the span of the entire day. Even if you just stayed for half an hour I would like to thank you so much for stopping by. There will be a post later regarding what we agreed on and went over in the two General Assemblies we had today.</p>
<p>You can find photos on our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/occupydc">Flickr</a> which will be updated by the hour as more photos and videos are getting posted online.</p>

				<p>Massive arrests going on now in NY. Watch <a href="http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution">http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution</a> (temporarily down). 9000 people reported protesting today, some netted on Brooklyn Bridge and arrested apparently indiscriminately.  Protesters remaining non-violent. We are all so proud of them for continuing their pledge of non-violence despite the maddening circumstanc they are in.</p>
<p>Two reporters arrested so far in the past hour: Ryan Devereaux, reporter from Democracy Now and Natasha Lennard, contributing reporter from NY. Both there to cover the protest. Maybe this is why we have a media blackout.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I am speechless about all of us who&#8217;ve been involved in this effort in the past 5 days whether with advice via email, support at the camp, planning, outreach, etc. There is so much synergy among those at the camp today it&#8217;s hard to describe. Match.com couldn&#8217;t have brought together a more compatible set of minds. Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to is so smart and down to earth and understands the situation we and the country are in at number of different levels which allows them to be both pragmatic as well as idealistic. I have a renewed sense hope in this country because of the people I&#8217;ve met down at the square today. Thank you all and much love!&#8221;</p>
<p>As of later today/tomorrow we will start posting meetings from the General Assemblies. We&#8217;ll try to aggregate as much media content as we can on this site as well to give you all a glimpse of what people are blogging about, taking pictures and videos of, etc.</p>

				<p>Good news everyone! Masks are allowed per our legal counsel but if police asks us to take them off they can be turned to the back of your head. Please read the stuff under the Preparation tab (<a href="http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/preparation/" target="_blank">http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/preparation/</a>).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Sleeping in the park:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Against the law; we can try it and see what happens but we may be asked to wake up or worse, disperse; do not despair .. if we have to disperse we can take a walk around the block and return;</li>
<li>Sleeping on sidewalk around the park is, however, ok;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Saturday&#8217;s schedule</h1>

<li>Whenever GA is done (approx 1-2 hours) committees will be named and reps will stand up; remember those names if you want to be in a committee or talk to Micah after the GA if you want to start your own;</li>

				<p>I would like to thank everyone that has contributed to this cause and all the energy that has put in. I would just like to remind you guys that you should spend some time today preparing for tomorrow. Make sure you have everything you need including food, water, cellphone, blankets, sweater, raincoat, signs, flyers, etc! Make sure to get familiar with the DC laws and go over our list that can be found <a href="http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/preparation/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently the <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/today/USDC0001">weather predictions</a> don&#8217;t look all the good for us and it will be rainy and cold so bring hot chocolate, a raincoat, and warm blankets and sweaters. There shouldn&#8217;t be any Metro delays but please do keep in mind that the Metro&#8217;s schedule is a tad slower in the weekend. You can go to the McPherson Square by either the Red line (Farragut North) or Orange and Blue (McPherson Sq). For directions and a map please have a look <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=216828758200249599482.0004ae1fddcb745721ec9&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=38.90188,-77.033708&amp;spn=0.006396,0.013733">here </a>on Google Maps.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t spend the entire day at McPherson Sq please just come by at some point of the day. We can use all the support that&#8217;s out there. For those that can not make it don&#8217;t worry, we will keep you updated on the website, Facebook, and the Twitter feed. If you can&#8217;t make it but like to help than you can do so by spreading the word out by telling your friends and sharing this website online.</p>

<p>I have been put in charge of the website and will be making sure it is up and running! At the moment we’re using WordPress.com to host our website, but we are planning to move soon to our own servers, hopefully next week. Until then we cannot do any big changes or make it more user-friendly than it already is. I would like to get the community’s input on what we can add, change, or remove as this is a people’s movement.</p>
<p>The goal of the website is to organize our ideas, goals, meetings, times and dates allowing people to quickly check what is happening via computer and smartphones. The website is here to bring people together and to act as a main hub for our Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr page(s).</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment with any ideas, suggestions, or comments!</p>
