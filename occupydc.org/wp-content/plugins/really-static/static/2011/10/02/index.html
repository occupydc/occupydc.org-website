				<p><em>This was unanimously voted on by all members of Occupy Wall Street last night, around 8pm, Sept 29. It is our first official document for release. We have three more underway, that will likely be released in the upcoming days: 1) A declaration of demands. 2) Principles of Solidarity 3) Documentation on how to form your own Direct Democracy Occupation Group.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together. We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies.</p>
<p>As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known.</p>
<p>They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.</p>
<p>They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.</p>
<p>They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals, and actively hide these practices.</p>
<p>They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.</p>
<p>They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.</p>
<p>They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.</p>
<p>They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.</p>
<p>They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.</p>
<p>They have sold our privacy as a commodity.</p>
<p>They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press.</p>
<p>They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.</p>
<p>They have donated large sums of money to politicians supposed to be regulating them.</p>
<p>They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.</p>
<p>They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantive profit.</p>
<p>They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.</p>
<p>They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.</p>
<p>They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.</p>
<p>They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts.*</p>
<p>To the people of the world,</p>
<p>We, the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, urge you to assert your power.</p>
<p>Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>To all communities that take action and form groups in the spirit of direct democracy, we offer support, documentation, and all of the resources at our disposal.</p>
<p>Join us and make your voices heard!</p>
<p>*These grievances are not all-inclusive.</p></blockquote>

<li>Concern is raised that the proliferation of committees is getting confusing, should avoid too much bureaucracy</li>
<li>Proposed: we won’t form any more committees until we grow bigger and the needs arise – approved</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agenda item 3: sleeping arrangements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is pointed out that sleeping in McPherson Square is illegal</li>
<li>It is confirmed that sleeping on sidewalks is not illegal</li>
<li><em>Facilitator proposes that anyone who wants to sleep here can sleep on the sidewalk in a group – <strong>approved</strong></em></li>
<li>Question is raised of whether we should have two meetings every day or just today – pros and cons are raised by a couple of people; concern is raised that 9 am is too early for some – general consensus</li>
<li><em>Facilitator proposes we agree to meetings per day, one at noon and one at six – <strong>approved</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Agenda item 4: Coming to a consensus about messaging/narrative/unified demands/grievances</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mo reads list she collected of peoples’ reasons for being here – they vary but there is a common thread of anger with corporate power, a call for cooperation and understanding</em></li>
<li><em>Facilitator proposes that since we’re cold and the meeting has been long, we agree to discuss messaging for 30 minutes &#8211; approved</em></li>
<li><em>Facilitator calls for everyone to express their ideas about what our unified narrative/messaging could be about:</em></li>
<li>Idea: our narrative, messaging be about corporations.</li>
<li>Idea: a central issue be campaign finance reform, “human need before corporate greed”.</li>
<li>Idea: crystallize the issue of human suffering.</li>
<li>Idea: this is a movement about fairness for all, compassion for all.</li>
<li>Idea: there is a sense of misery, fear, and powerlessness; this movement is about providing a space for us all to come together and discuss the issues behind that fear.</li>
<li>Idea: we should identify common grievances rather than agree on common demands.</li>
<li>Idea: this movement is about spreading the message that we’re the first generation since WWII to have it worse than our parents; we’re scared and we need help from the 99 percent.</li>
<li>Idea: we shouldn’t agree on a set list of goals right now because we don’t want to alienate anyone who could come later; let’s not take away their agency the way ours has been taken from us.</li>
<li>Idea: we should focus on conversations for now, get to know each other, feel out how we all feel, let our unified message grow organically.</li>
<li>Idea: we can control/unify our message by having a general consensus about the problem and making our<em> </em>own media, each person can express their own specific views.</li>
<li><em>Facilitator proposes that what he’s hearing is we all want a general consensus on grievances but we don’t want to box ourselves in by getting too specific.</em></li>
<li>Idea: stick with other occupy movements and stand with them on their unified messaging.</li>
<li>Idea: rather than say we’re mad about income inequality per se, say we’re mad about the power that is bestowed upon those with money; we want to separate political progress from profit.</li>
<li>Idea: we need to define what the phrase “We are the 99%” means</li>
<li>Idea: we need to stop worrying about coming up with a unified message for the benefit of the media, because they’re going to say whatever they say no matter what; we need to worry about coming up with a unified message for the benefit of people on the street, for the purpose of recruiting more people to join us.</li>
<li><em>Facilitator announces that 30 minutes are up, proposes we continue at tomorrow’s GA – <strong>approved</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>GA adjourned</em></p>

				<p>While many of us are sleeping in our comfy beds tonight, a handful of brave protestors are sleeping outside to Occupy DC! They have been supplied with warm blankets, foods, and rain gear but have moved out of the McPherson Square and found a dry doorway. I would urge everybody to give them warm coffee, chocolate milk, and food tomorrow morning because its freezing and wet outside. Here is a short video supplied by imnottouchingyou (IRC).</p>
