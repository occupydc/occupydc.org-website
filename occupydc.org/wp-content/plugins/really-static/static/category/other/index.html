				<p><em>This was unanimously voted on by all members of Occupy Wall Street last night, around 8pm, Sept 29. It is our first official document for release. We have three more underway, that will likely be released in the upcoming days: 1) A declaration of demands. 2) Principles of Solidarity 3) Documentation on how to form your own Direct Democracy Occupation Group.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together. We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies.</p>
<p>As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known.</p>
<p>They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.</p>
<p>They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of oneâ€™s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.</p>
<p>They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals, and actively hide these practices.</p>
<p>They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.</p>
<p>They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.</p>
<p>They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workersâ€™ healthcare and pay.</p>
<p>They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.</p>
<p>They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.</p>
<p>They have sold our privacy as a commodity.</p>
<p>They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press.</p>
<p>They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.</p>
<p>They have donated large sums of money to politicians supposed to be regulating them.</p>
<p>They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.</p>
<p>They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save peopleâ€™s lives in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantive profit.</p>
<p>They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.</p>
<p>They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.</p>
<p>They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad.</p>
<p>They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.</p>
<p>They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts.*</p>
<p>To the people of the world,</p>
<p>We, the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, urge you to assert your power.</p>
<p>Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>To all communities that take action and form groups in the spirit of direct democracy, we offer support, documentation, and all of the resources at our disposal.</p>
<p>Join us and make your voices heard!</p>
<p>*These grievances are not all-inclusive.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Massive arrests going on now in NY. Watch <a href="http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution">http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution</a> (temporarily down). 9000 people reported protesting today, some netted on Brooklyn Bridge and arrested apparently indiscriminately.Â  Protesters remaining non-violent. We are all so proud of them for continuing their pledge of non-violence despite the maddening circumstanc they are in.</p>
<p>Two reporters arrested so far in the past hour: Ryan Devereaux, reporter from Democracy Now and Natasha Lennard, contributing reporter from NY. Both there to cover the protest. Maybe this is why we have a media blackout.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I am speechless about all of us who&#8217;ve been involved in this effort in the past 5 days whether with advice via email, support at the camp, planning, outreach, etc. There is so much synergy among those at the camp today it&#8217;s hard to describe. Match.com couldn&#8217;t have brought together a more compatible set of minds. Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to is so smart and down to earth and understands the situation we and the country are in at number of different levels which allows them to be both pragmatic as well as idealistic. I have a renewed sense hope in this country because of the people I&#8217;ve met down at the square today. Thank you all and much love!&#8221;</p>
<p>As of later today/tomorrow we will start posting meetings from the General Assemblies. We&#8217;ll try to aggregate as much media content as we can on this site as well to give you all a glimpse of what people are blogging about, taking pictures and videos of, etc.</p>

				<p>Good news everyone! Masks are allowed per our legal counsel but if police asks us to take them off they can be turned to the back of your head. Please read the stuff under the Preparation tab (<a href="http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/preparation/" target="_blank">http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/preparation/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the other directions do not bring the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pocket knife, Leatherman or Swiss army knife with blade bigger than 3 inches;</li>
<li>Things that require storage (against the law to have in a park) so if you can&#8217;t carry it on you for a period of time if needed, it can&#8217;t be there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sleeping in the park:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Against the law; we can try it and see what happens but we may be asked to wake up or worse, disperse; do not despair .. if we have to disperse we can take a walk around the block and return;</li>
<li>Sleeping on sidewalk around the park is, however, ok;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Saturday&#8217;s schedule</h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">First 1/2 of the day:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>9:00 welcome stand has fliers with important legal information. You need to read this stuff!</li>
<li>9:30 welcome message, overview of legal (5-10 mins max)</li>
<li>9:40 General Assembly begins (Micah will be explaining the process and we&#8217;ll move straight into our first GA by establishing the ground rules)</li>
<li>Whenever GA is done (approx 1-2 hours) committees will be named and reps will stand up; remember those names if you want to be in a committee or talk to Micah after the GA if you want to start your own;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lunch</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Second 1/2 of the day</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Making signs</li>
<li>Legal observer training</li>
<li>Training on how to handle police</li>
<li>A second GA (getting into the fun stuff)</li>
<li>Hanging out, making friends, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember it is YOU who dictate the success and longevity of this movement. Get involved, don&#8217;t be apathetic, listen to others, be respectful, and have PATIENCE! <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p>Tonight&#8217;s been a long night already for all of us and we&#8217;ve accomplished a lot. Tomorrow is our last day to organize before the first GA on Saturday.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll put up an October 1st preparedness page with information on legal tips, what to bring, ground rules, etc. That will be available before EOD Friday. Before then we need as many people as possible to familiarize themselves with the General Assembly rules: <a href="http://takethesquare.net/2011/07/31/quick-guide-on-group-dynamics-in-peoples-assemblies/">http://takethesquare.net/2011/07/31/quick-guide-on-group-dynamics-in-peoples-assemblies</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see that a number of generic tabs have disappeared. Today we&#8217;ll be populating a couple of pages with pertinent information about the event. We&#8217;re all now making a move from the planning stage to an operational stage and the site will start reflecting that.</p>

<p><strong>General conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>- despite having other issues on the agenda our main message is to repeal corporate personhood and in particular Citizens United</p>
<p>- our group will continue to remain a democratically organized group without leaders but with plenty of coordinators who maintain the necessary functions of the movement</p>
<p>- although we are in agreeance with all the other occupy groups we plan on having the above-mentioned focus as a goal</p>
<p>- we do not expect chats prior to Oct 1st to help us with refining a message or really achieve anything past planning and logistics</p>
<p>- we understand there will be disagreement and are ready to unite around those issues on which we all agree</p>
