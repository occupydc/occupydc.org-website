			<p>Let&#8217;s do this guys. No more one-day protests. No more apathy. No more giving up. No more giving in. </p>
<p>I reeeally think the first order of business is a Twitter so we have something to point people to for info. Right now there are some great compendiums of worldwide #occupy movements going around, and a lot of them either don&#8217;t list DC or give our Twitter as @occupydc, which is dead and likely to stay that way. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve checked and the following handles are available:</p>
<p>@occupycapcity<br />
@occupywashdc<br />
@occupycaphill<br />
@occupy1600penn <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Thoughts? Feelings?</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>

			<p>Agreed! I took @occupyKst .. figured that&#8217;s symbolic of the movement like others have said and will post from that account from now on. We need to let people know about October 1st .. we need to stand strong on the promise to join the other national movements.</p>
<p>I would say let&#8217;s take as many @occupy(dc) related tags but i&#8217;m afraid people would retweet or reply without adding a general hashtag that joins us all together. What do you think babyeienstein?</p>
<p>I think we may want to stay away from @occupywhitehouse or @occupythehill .. i don&#8217;t think the point we&#8217;re trying to make is that we want a coup. We need to be approachable by the general public .. we need everyone to feel like they and we are part of the 99%. That&#8217;s a powerful idea.</p>

			<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m really into @occupykst, I think it makes perfect sense with the Wall Street spirit. I was (mostly) kidding about @occupywhitehouse, I think you&#8217;re right that&#8217;s a little&#8230;aggressive. </p>
<p>I also am with you on the single Twitter handle &#8211; the goal should be more centralization, not less and this way people know for sure where to go to get the most up-to-the-minute information. </p>
<p>Now all we need is a meet-up spot for October 1st, right? Are we aiming to truly be near K St.? I wish we had a lawyer who could advise on legal/illegal locations&#8230;</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s going to be at Freedom Plaza, a bit south of K street. Freedom Plaza is actually on Penn Ave, pretty close to the white house. If we decided to move it to K street, I have no idea where would be a (legal) place to go.</p>
<p>See you guys on Friday!</p>

<p>Any idea on numbers, by the way? I&#8217;ll show up either way, but I&#8217;m curious if this has anywhere near the interest of OWS.</p>

			<p>Haha, I actually figured that one was meant for me, thanks. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave the numbers question to someone with more info, but I will say that Stop the Machine, the folks showing up on Oct. 6, have about 4k Facebook fans and almost 2k Twitter followers. They also have about 50 comments on their message board. So apply some basic social media math and I personally am expecting maybe 100 people, honestly, for what my opinion is worth. </p>
<p>But I also have a LOT of faith that this will grow fast. Unemployment isn&#8217;t nearly as high here right now, as I&#8217;m sure you know if you live here too, which I think will have a negative impact on numbers (most of us have to go to work on Monday), but we also have a disproportionate number of politically-aware high school kids and college kids &#8211; I know I cut my fair share of classes to go to anti-war rallies in high school, so I&#8217;m hoping we can get our numbers up from that demographic. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m stoked either way. Got my sleeping bag ready!</p>

			<p>No idea on numbers .. I got comments on twitter from I&#8217;d say 3 dozen people. Yesterday we had 175 hits on this page and today so far close to 500. That doesn&#8217;t mean anything of course but those are the only numbers I have to share.</p>

			<p>Well&#8230; it&#8217;d be legal, but the areas you go to are going to heavily influence whether cops are willing to kick you out or not. Over in the legal section it says </p>
<p>&#8220;The imposition of restrictions may occur:<br />
…<br />
(c) During a First Amendment assembly where a plan was not approved for the assembly.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we decide to move to K Street, it&#8217;d be better to plan ahead and figure out a spot cops are going to be more willing to let us hang out at and/or spend the night. We don&#8217;t want to get arrested because we made a bad choice in tent location.</p>

We are just the local occupy group organized in the vein of all other occupy groups throughout the country. We are an independent, democratically organized group. </p>
<p>Our event on the 1st is in unison with other occupy protests around the country. Check out <a href="http://occupytogether.org">http://occupytogether.org</a>, <a href="http://occupywallst.org">http://occupywallst.org</a>, etc</p>

			<p>Wow. I thought October2011 WAS the occupyDC. Had no idea they were two different movements aligned. I bet a lot of people are thinking they are one and the same. I didn&#8217;t realize occupyDC was different until I went to the occupy together site that told me this event was on October 1st. I was soooooo confused!</p>
<p>Anyway, I will be coming to both events and am excited about the movements. If we, the people, do not rise up and make our voices heard, then the top 1% will keep getting away with their crimes against humanity. Americans have become so pacified and dumbed down to the injustice around us. That needs to change immediately or else we&#8217;re doomed.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to see you all on Oct. 1st!</p>

			<p>Occupydc is kicking BUTT on this, the facebook page is up and running: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/OccupyDC-K-St/281692221859119">https://www.facebook.com/pages/OccupyDC-K-St/281692221859119</a>. She&#8217;s up impressively early too. </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s wise to choose from the list of locations at which you don&#8217;t need a permit to protest, yes? We definitely qualify as a demonstration according to the DC laws, and I&#8217;m guessing (hoping) we&#8217;ll have more than 25 people. I&#8217;m seeing McPherson Sq on the front page &#8211; is this our final decision? I think it&#8217;s the best pick, but we should nail it down. </p>
<p>Meeting and then marching might be tricky &#8211; I think we count as a demonstration even if we&#8217;re in transit, but I also doubt the cops will be, like, waiting for us at our meeting spot. I&#8217;d be interested in getting more legal clarification on this. </p>
<p>Now, if I&#8217;m reading this right (<a href="http://prop1.org/legal/cfrregs/fr82064.htm">http://prop1.org/legal/cfrregs/fr82064.htm</a>), it looks like we&#8217;re allowed to camp if camping is an integral part of our demonstration and it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;re not living there (this might limit our ability to do things like prepare food or erect tents). But I also think getting a permit would eliminate any doubts about this, and it looks like the ACLU might even be willing to intervene on our behalf if we do everything right but still get messed with. </p>
<p>We actually still have time to get a permit &#8211; they require 48 hours of lead time. Does anyone feel like this would be a worthwhile investment? To be totally honest I&#8217;m dealing with DC government (a different branch) all day today and tomorrow and the idea of trying to get a permit gives me a migraine, but if anyone has some free time to investigate it further, I think that might be a nice bit of extra insurance against the cops. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited!!</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t see the core requiring us to get a permit. And in all that stuff I&#8217;ve seen a wait of 14 days not 48 hours. Are you sure? Also, I&#8217;m under the impression that you have to get a permit for each day you&#8217;re planning on protesting. I agree it needs to be investigated; we need as much on our side as possible. I have doubts about the ACLU though .. they didn&#8217;t seem to do anything to help OWS but I may just be short on info. I&#8217;m a big fan of theirs and all don&#8217;t get me wrong <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>I think McPherson would work best as well. Looks like it&#8217;s fine without permit for up to 500 people. Still not sure about Pershing Park .. I think that would be an ideal start location because given that it&#8217;s a weekend we&#8217;ll have visibility to visitors, etc. Plus it&#8217;s a very comfortable location (other than the amount of Secret Service &amp; police near by). Starting on K St might work if we have some good lobbying firm targets near by McPherson .. the move would just be symbolic I think. Either way it works as long as there&#8217;s plenty of us <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>I asked that at first too. The October 1st date is the day of national solidarity with the #occupy movements happening around the world, so the idea behind gathering on that day is to send a very clear message: we stand with Occupy Wall Street, with Occupy Denver, with Occupy Houston, etc etc. The October 6th rally has been in the works for a while, and originated as an anti-war protest if I&#8217;m not mistaken &#8211; or I guess more like an anti-military industrial complex protest. So it&#8217;s mututally beneficial for us to join forces &#8211; we all pretty much want the same, our numbers will be way bigger, plus they have permits and committees and all that jazz. </p>
<p>So in essence, it&#8217;s up to you. If you want to start early and meet a smaller core of folks, come meet us on the 1st! If you&#8217;d rather wait til the big guns roll in, we&#8217;ll see you on the 6th. </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait!</p>

			<p>I personally thing it&#8217;s important to have a showing of the local DC occupiers even if it&#8217;s just for a few days. The occupy movements are all about being leaderless and democratic in their decision making. It&#8217;s about showing that it is possible for people to work towards something together without support from a party or larger organization. It&#8217;s about giving everyone a voice to set the agenda.</p>
<p>October2011 is a well organized and well connected effort and I think we&#8217;re all happy to be living in this area so we can witness the speakers they&#8217;re bringing on the 6th (Chris Hedges is the man!) but they are a large nation-wide organization. </p>
<p>We simply want to show solidarity with this unprecedented mode of organization for our generation. Not through MoveOn, not through some other non-profit, not through funding. Just people asking for their rights as citizens.</p>

			<p>@occupydc: I think your characterization of the Stop the Machine &#8220;occupation&#8221; is inaccurate. It seems not to be an organization at all, but an ad-hoc working group of people who have spent a long time as activists for social justice, and done so in a way that is certainly not related to the approach of MoveOn or any other advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party. Also, their &#8220;15 points of unity&#8221; are not just about the military industrial complex, but many other relevant issues that they plan to hash out in exactly the same way as those on Wall St. are.</p>
<p>I only say all of this because, if we look at the history of social justice movements in the US, one of the major failures has been the inability of groups with similar or even identical aims to collaborate. The public, the media, and probably even many participants will not be able to distinguish the two events, so I just urge a unified approach as things unfold.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t know what you mean about the characterization of StopTheMachine .. they have been organizing for a long time and are an organization with branches in all states it seems. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re a 503(c) if that&#8217;s what you mean but they&#8217;re all organizers with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t talk for everyone but I think most if not all of us agree on their points. </p>
<p>Also, unless some people get really attached to McPherson Sq. we are all planning on joining them on the 6th so I don&#8217;t see where your concern of a unified approach comes from .. that&#8217;s as unified as it gets <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>Good question! We need to put up a bigger list of needs and figuring out how we can set up 4G capability is one of them.</p>
<p>One option is the Samsung 4G SCH-LC11. Any other options that you know of?</p>
<p>We can mooch off of free wifi spots for blogging, etc but that won&#8217;t do for streaming.<br />
Wifi spots in the area: <a href="http://bit.ly/oGjGzu">http://bit.ly/oGjGzu</a></p>

			<p>I would really like to be able to come, but i&#8217;m not sure that i&#8217;d be able to. Is there anything worthwhile &amp; useful that people can do even if they can&#8217;t make it to a protest? I&#8217;ve been spreading the word online about Occupy Wall Street; is there anything else that can be done? (And if i were able to come down, i&#8217;d probably only be able to stay for the one day, which i guess seems counter intuitive to the message that these protests are trying to send. Should i take that into consideration?)</p>

			<p>Caitly, thank you so much for wanting to get involved.</p>
<p>Even coming for a day would be great. Not all of us will be able to consistently come to the site daily or spend the nights. The more the better whenever we can get people.<br />
Spreading the word is the most important, for sure. Other than that currently we&#8217;re making various lists. Would you be able to help compile a list of lobbying firms on K St? We&#8217;re interested for sure in those hired by: financial services corps, multi-national corporations, foreign governments. Oil &amp; gas would be nice too. Any other ones anyone can think of? </p>
<p>Would you be able to support with that?<br />
Thanks again and welcome!</p>

			<p>Great to have you Victor and looking forward to meeting you on Saturday. We have a few other people coming down from Wall Street on Oct 1 and it&#8217;s exciting to have you guys!</p>
<p>Oct 6 is a large organized event put up by an organization named October2011. They seem to have been planning it for a while. I think they have a permit for the day but they&#8217;re also planning on having people occupy that night and thereafter in Freedom Plaza. Most people here are planning on attending those festivities.</p>

			<p>Will be interesting to see if they will be able to Occupy Freedom Plaza starting on the 8th as that is Taste of DC which is in Freedom Plaza. THey would definitely have plenty of food that weekend and also entertainment during the day. Might be a great place to march to on the 8th and 9th since it&#8217;s normally jammed packed.</p>

			<p>Here is a list of things a friend of mine who is way more versed in protesting than I and will likely be joining me Sunday sent last night. She is clearly opinionated but I feel like everything here makes sense on some level. I hope this is helpful to anyone.</p>
<p>&#8212;quote&#8212; </p>
<p>I hope you wont need this:</p>
<p>Put three tsp Milk of Magnesia in 16 ounces of water, splash on skin or eyeballs to relieve chemicals intrusions. Always guide chemicals FROM inner TO outer corner of eye, AWAY from tear duct. Never guide anything toward your tear duct. The pain from a chemical burn is excruciating, but it is temporary.</p>
<p>If someone calls you from a rooftop, don&#8217;t look up. They do this so that they can get a clear photo of your face&#8230;</p>
<p>Make sure to wear lots of non-oily sunscreen, rubbed in WELL, and bring way more water than you think you need. Drink in small sips frequently, try to avoid making yourself have to pee. I recommend sunglasses you don&#8217;t care about and a hat with a brim, but your goal is to look as nondescript as possible, so nothing too fancy. &#8220;Bucket&#8221; style hats are good. Do NOT wear a mask, this is grounds for arrest. Pack your hipsack with a bandanna to hold in front of your nose and mouth if they gas you, the bandanna is folded, soaked in vinegar, sealed in two ziplock bags. Also packets of emergen-C, band-aids, apples and Larabars, bring extras to give away if you like. People will want them. Hair is tied together and up or back, shoes are the most comfortable ones you&#8217;ve ever had. Your hands are free, your cellphone is fully charged. Your lawyer&#8217;s phone number and an emergency number are written on your arm in Sharpie, but under your shirt where they are not immediately visible. Your clothes are the type that will keep you dignified in jail when stripped down to their lowest common denominator: t-shirts and simple pants are good, nothing too complicated that jail guards might take issue with. If you get arrested, they will take any extraneous layers, ie: You can&#8217;t wear more than one shirt, so no button-fronts over t-shirts, or anything like that.</p>
<p>You do NOT follow the crowd, that&#8217;s how you get penned in. Marching is fun, but always know an escape route. You are always aware of the crowds&#8217; movements, you don&#8217;t follow them &#8220;off a cliff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Practice what to do if you get arrested. Breath deeply and slowly, talk in a friendly way with your fellow protesters, but don&#8217;t tell them anything in case they&#8217;re undercover. Do not tell the police ANYTHING. You CANNOT talk your way out of getting arrested or charged, do not say ANYTHING other than your name, address, date of birth. Say NOTHING except &#8220;I want to talk with my attorney.&#8221; If you are nice to jail guards, they will be nice to you, but do not tell them ANYTHING, no matter how harmless it seems. THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO THEM THAT WILL HELP. I cannot emphasize this enough. Busting protesters is a video-game to cops. They feel that they are &#8220;against&#8221; you. It doesn&#8217;t matter how smart or charming you are, they want to take you down. Jail guards are typically nicer than cops, but not always.</p>
<p>If you get arrested, do NOT freak out. Remember that this too shall pass, no matter what happens, you will soon be safe in your own bed. Even if it takes a few days, you WILL get out eventually, and you will NOT be in any serious trouble. There will be lots of fellow protesters with you, and they will help protect you if you let them. Align with them immediately. The point of jail is to confuse you. A confused prisoner is an obedient prisoner. Be polite in jail no matter what, and try to keep a smile on your face to help the time go by. Remember, this is TEMPORARY. Singing in jail is fun if your friend are into it, but don&#8217;t get on their nerves. No matter how frightening things get in jail, you are NOT in serious trouble, and you WILL get out soon. No matter how much they try to confuse or scare you, it just doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s temporary, stay brave, it will be over soon no matter what.</p>
<p>If you are alert enough, you can typically avoid arrest, but cops do lunge over barriers to accost pretty girls, people they think look vulnerable, etc. If a cop grabs someone near you, either get the fuck away, or grab the person and try to pull them back to your side. This is a split-second judgment call, and can be very difficult. Obviously, let go rather than hurting the person. For this reason, I recommend marching in the center of the block, not near the rails. If you&#8217;re near the rails, you&#8217;re on high alert for grabby hands.</p>
<p>You will probably not get arrested, so don&#8217;t let this freak you out too much. Be prepared to witness abysmal behavior on the part of the authorities, but don&#8217;t let it crush you emotionally. Be brave, you are doing the right thing. Do not let them scare you. When you live in terror, terrorists win. Be vibrant. Have so much fun that the cops want to join your side.</p>

			<p>The Cops in DC generally issue 3 warnings and allow people to leave prior to arresting. This isn&#8217;t always the case, if they feel that people are being disrespectful they arrest without warning for the slightest cause..</p>

			<p>Hi peary,</p>
<p>occupydc and I are getting stretched thinner and thinner &#8211; would you be willing to take responsibility for keeping track of what people say we need and looking for them on Freecycle and Craigslist? Would be much appreciated, especially by occupydc&#8217;s son and my partner. <img src='http://occupydc.org/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static//wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-content/plugins/really-static/static/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<p>Maybe you should show up wearing the ONE and ONLY suit you own to show how deeply concerned you are about image. </p>

			<p>Not all of us are, ever were, ever could be, or would ever want to be &#8220;young professionals.&#8221; Disgust with Wall Street, the Banksters, and their bought-and-paid for politicians extends far beyond those who ever were promised a middle-class life. I&#8217;ve been fighting them since 1982, brought into politics by the El Salvador War and the efforts of Ronald Reagan to bring back the draft.</p>

			<p>I’m planning on attending tomorrow, and I’m very enthused about the chance to take part in this movement. But I have a few questions too…<br />
• Is there a permit for this demo? Or are we going to be purely exercising out 1st amendment rights?<br />
• Are we going to be marching any where after we assemble @ McPherson square? Or are we just “occupying” it?<br />
• I want to make sure I’m there when the official “counts” are being done by the cops and the press. Does any one know when that happens? If I’m there for at least a couple of hours will that ensure that I’ve been counted?<br />
• For the veterans out there, what are the chances that there will be friction with the cops? I have no problem with getting arrested per-sey, but I do need to get to work on Monday. Also, thanks to every one that has posted the protest “best practices” tips all over the #occupy solidarity sites</p>

			<p>Hi Alex! Doesn&#8217;t look like anyone responded to your concerns. Glad to see you&#8217;re coming out tomorrow!</p>
<p>1. At McPherson Square, NO PERMIT is needed for groups under 500. If more than 500 people show up  (which is always possible as OccupyAustin had over 500 people show up last night to their first meeting!) we&#8217;ll probably have to talk about getting a permit.</p>
<p>2. We will decide whether we should march depending on the turnout tomorrow and how our General Assembly goes.</p>
<p>3. I don&#8217;t know about any official counts but apparently, some media folks will be there. I&#8217;m sure someone will be counting or keeping an eye on it. I&#8217;m very interested to see what it will be!</p>
<p>4. We&#8217;re not sure how the cops will react to this. I&#8217;m not sure what the consensus is on D.C. cops and how they usually behave like other cities. At the General Assembly, this will definitely be addressed, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great questions! Email <a href="mailto:occupydc@hush.com">occupydc@hush.com</a> or <a href="mailto:occupywashdc@gmail.com">occupywashdc@gmail.com</a> if you have any more? See you tomorrow!</p>

			<p>Read this Reddit post &#8211; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kw3fx/to_all_occupy_wall_street_participants_here_is/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kw3fx/to_all_occupy_wall_street_participants_here_is/</a></p>
<p>And remember Eddie Izzard: &#8220;70% of what people react to is the look, you know, it&#8217;s how you look; and 20% is about how you sound; and only 10% is what you say.&#8221; </p>
<p>Apparently, you are your f#$king khakis, and while it might suck to realize this, remember this isn&#8217;t a game we&#8217;re playing. This is a strategy to get our country back from robber barons and corrupt politicians.  </p>
<p>The 99% don&#8217;t look like tatooed pierced hippies, they look like Mr. and Mrs. Joe the Plumber (for lack of a better reference). If we can get some images of protesters looking like normal young professionals, we&#8217;ll start winning the PR battle. Even more so if there are images of police brutality against people who look like normal officer workers. </p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t take offense to any of this. I just think it&#8217;s time we wore up and started using the system to beat the system.</p>

			<p>Hi. I suppose it is too late to suggest that the occupation be closer to the Capitol office buildings. But I think that is the most important and influential place in all of DC. If you want to put pressure on those people who make decisions, THAT is the place to do it. Protests should especially be felt in front of the House office buildings, as that is where the wall street suck-ups are most present. That is where many of the most recent bad decisions have come from. This is THE MOST EFFECTIVE thing I can think of for this movement to do: march twice a day (9 am and 6 pm &#8211; Capitol rush hours) from the House office buildings (Rayburn, Longworth and Cannon) on Independence Ave., walk past the Supreme Court on 1st St. to the Senate office buildings (Russel and Dirksen). At these times all of the Congressmen and congressional staffers are arriving or leaving their offices. </p>
<p>Yes, the lobbyists on K St. are bad, but they are ultimately not the ones who make the bad decisions. Congress is. If you want to bring about real change, you must target Congress. We need to focus on strategic points of leverage. I suggest this to you as someone who works in a Congressman&#8217;s office. This would be most effective. </p>
<p>Also, it would give us the opportunity to regularly visit our representatives&#8217; offices and ask them what they are doing to stop corporate greed. We can ask them EVERYDAY. We can ask them personally. There is nothing more powerful than someone standing in his/her Congressperson&#8217;s office, politely asking tough questions. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how or if this can be integrated with a basecamp at McPherson Square. Thoughts?</p>

			<p>Oh, and by the way, occupying DC is, in my opinion, more effective and important than occupying Wall St. Why? Because Congress has the power to regulate Wall St. Wall St. will keep on stealing money from tax payers and profiting off of human misery until the law steps in. That is the job of Congress. So putting enough pressure at the Capitol could be much more productive than on Wall St. itself, even if the changes we want to see will ultimately happen at Wall St. </p>
<p>Therefore, OCCUPY DC IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OCCUPATION IN AMERICA.</p>

			<p>I realized I may have come off as combative, so I apologize. Long day. I think your concerns are legitimate, but they do depart a bit from the general message; I bet tomorrow we&#8217;ll have a chance to talk about it and kind of figure out where we&#8217;re at. Nothing&#8217;s set in stone, we&#8217;re all in this together. I&#8217;m stoked to see everyone! I think once we get to sit down face to face this is going to really gather steam. !!!</p>

			<p>I cannot be at the GA this morning but will try to be there by midday. Here is a response to babyeinstein&#8217;s concerns:</p>
<p>I understand that this movement has so far been aimed at the lobbyists themselves. But I am telling you that energy misdirected is energy wasted. Yes, you are right, lobbyists help write legislation. But who invites them in to do that? Who accepts their money? Who are the lobbyists continuously trying to influence? CONGRESS. Lobbyists wold have no power if Congress didn&#8217;t give it to them. Laws and regulations (or a lack of them) allow lobbyists to be the insidious force within out political system. </p>
<p>Expecting corporations to self-regulate with a bit of public pressure is unrealistic. However, asking elected officials to take action against corporations is MUCH MORE realistic &#8211; the entire point of their existence is to listen to constituent concerns and act upon them (the original intent). We must remind them of their duties, because many have certainly forgotten them. </p>
<p>For most elected officials, their main concern is reelection. For most corporations, their main concern is profit. Luckily, public pressure has a much more directly correlation to the fear of not being reelected than the fear of losing profit. That&#8217;s my two-cents.</p>

			<p>YES i do like that idea of protesting in the face of congress. main reason is congress is by law not allowed to solicit monies from the congress bldg. so they simply walk across the street to call centers to do there dirty work. if we set up in suggested area this will 1 get there attention #2 allow America see how they are leaving there post to go to work for the bribe monies.</p>

			<p>I get where you guys are coming from. But the thing as, at least as far as I understand it, is that Occupy Wall Street, and every occupy movement subsequent, is that the whole point is that it isn&#8217;t Congress. It isn&#8217;t our elected officials, it&#8217;s the people controlling our elected officials. And those people are the moneyed class. They&#8217;re the ones donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to politicians whose campaigns specifically pander to their corporate interests. When the health care bill was written, there were six lobbyists working on it for every one lawmaker. Who do you think is calling the shots?</p>

			<p>We are gathered here today…because I have a pipedream. The Tarsands Pipeline is a Trojan Horse for Terrorism. It will connect to a refinery on American soil, owned by Saudi Arabia and it will create a product shipped off to China. This will all come back to us as a toxic waste dump disguised as play toys. It is a 1500 mile long fuse going through our backyards to a carbon bomb the size of Florida. Imagine Tarsands Pipeline meets Bastrop Fire. This is a napalm scalpel that will divide this country in half. We will all try to escape into the ocean like lemmings swimming to Cuba. We do not have the ability to stop it from leaking into the aquifers and we do not have the ability to put out the fire. The collateral damage is ours. Dispersants are not going to cover this up. Tarsands Pipeline is the last straw.<br />
Oil business is founded on death from the Dodo birds to the whales boiled down into train oil. If you work for this business then you are a puppet to genocide. The owners have only one unashamed priority and that is to have as much money and power as possible right up to the end of human existence. There is a choice: Nuclear/Oil Slaves or Nature/Loving Farmers.<br />
	Causes need to join forces! Cannabis prohibition needs to end immediately for: industrial, medical, and recreational use. Decriminalize and control it like alcohol because it is a neuroprotectant. Swedish University has released a study confirming Jack Herer’s marijuana biomass energy plan is legitimate and the solution for organic power is right under our noses.<br />
	That is why marijuana is illegal.  Archeological artifacts date cannabis domestication back to the beginning of civilization. We have cannabinoids receptors in our DNA. Henry Ford built a fleet of 40 cars that were made from hemp fibers and ran on hemp fuel. He was in direct competition with Rockefeller and DuPont to supply chemicals and energy. That is when Anslinger stepped in with brainwashing propaganda and designed the racist incarceration complex that flourishes in this country and around the world. American business is rape, pillage, and plunder. This is capital war.<br />
	It is my maternal and patriotic duty to share the miracle band aid that will cure all of the world’s booboos. Cannabis will save the planet. It phytoremediates pollution including: toxic heavy metals and radioactive elements from the soil, and water. It photosynthesizes CO2 into O2 and filters pollution from the air and our lungs.<br />
	Medical marijuana will end the epidemic of opiate addictions and the job security for pharmaceutical dealers. Decriminalize recreational use and we all could just get along.<br />
	We need to eliminate all GMO’s with extinction coded into the DNA. Monsanto’s genetically modified cannabis has already adulterated the black-market supply. Welcome back Agent Orange. Vote with your money and support Organic Consumers Association.<br />
	If cannabis was never demonized in the first place, then we would never have needed to clear cut old growth forests. We would not have needed Exxon Valdez, Chevron, Shell, BP, Long Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima.<br />
	We need the Army Corp of Engineers to design and build a pipeline system to send us water not death.  End the risk of nuclear meltdowns caused by fire or flood by relieving flood and drought disaster areas at the same time.  We need to grow more pot everywhere. New York City can be the city center hub for Medical Growth and Industrial Growth can sweep across the country side. Roll a huge sacrificial joint and shove it into a volcano. If we hotbox the world then we can close all the holes in the ozone and all of our problems can be solved. Russia is about to have a Cannabis Boom. Why aren’t we? Cannabis is the ultimate WMP, Weapon of Mass Peace.</p>

			<p>Occupy DC Protest October 1, 2011 – Day One &#8211; President Obama Drives By!!! </p>
<p>I arrived at McPherson Square just after 12 noon to take part in the Occupy DC protest. I&#8217;m standing in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and all the other nationwide protests beginning to take place.  I never thought We&#8217;d actually see President Barack Obama, but we did! More on that in a little bit&#8230;  </p>
<p>It was a very chilly 50-55 degrees with light rain showers off and which likely dampened the turnout of protesters and activists. But several dozen diehard folks refused to let bad weather suppress their voices of discontent.  At the peak of the turnout my best guess would be that there was 50 to 75 people.  I spent the first of couple hours speaking with protesters on K street (K Street in NW DC is the epicenter of lobbying firms, and just two blocks from the White House) who were holding up signs, waving, and interacting with traffic.  They were getting lots of honks from passing cars, and positive feedback from pedestrians. You can listen to all of those interviews and audio from the protest on the FFR audio page.  </p>
<p>Most of the protesters, probably 75 % on them, were in their 20&#8242;s-30&#8242;s.  Some were carrying signs saying “Honk if you have student debt,” which most of the people that I spoke with did in fact have.  </p>
<p>The overall atmosphere was very positive, respectful, and courteous.  Everyone was cooperative with all laws.  There were no police to be found for a majority of the day.  Until a little after 5pm when we began to see a few police cars stationed at all four corners of McPherson Square, the site of the protest. I wasn&#8217;t paying close attention to the time as I was speaking with other fellow activists, but it was just beginning to get dark, my best guess is around 7pm.  When all of a sudden we began to hear police sirens.  Lots of sirens. Within a matter of seconds, several dozen police cars, all with lights flashing, had the entire park surrounded.  I knew something was up.   </p>
<p>I was looking around trying to see why all these police suddenly showed up out of nowhere.  There was no sign of a traffic accident, no sign of an emergency, and no reason for tons of police. Then I began to start to see motorcycle police, one after another, in single file coming up 15thSt NW crossing I St and heading towards K St. I had this deep gut feeling something was about to happen.  I grabbed one of the signs from our pile, it read “Corporations Are Not People,” and began running to the corner of 15th and I St, while shouting to all of the activists to grab a sign because something was happening.   </p>
<p>Police cars lined all the surrounding streets, several traffic police on foot were standing in the intersections. The nearest officer on foot noticed all of us bunching up on the sidewalk and came towards us, blowing his whistle and demanding that we all step back from the street.  We all obeyed the orders.  Then, at that exact moment, we realized from all the black SUV&#8217;s with tinted windows, that it was the Presidential motorcade. One protester shouted, “It&#8217;s Obama! Obama is here!”  Literally right on cue there it was: President Obama&#8217;s new armor-plated Cadillac Limousine known to insiders as “Beast.”  And for the first time in my life, I saw the President of the United States with my own eyes. </p>
<p>I was speechless, almost in a mild shock. There he was. The man we&#8217;d been trying to reach with our message.  Everything was moving in slow motion for me.  In real time he was there for no more than two or three seconds.  I saw him turn and look at us.  I just stared, others around me began to cheer enthusiastically.  It was a truly amazing moment.  Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t think to turn my audio recorder back on until the motorcade was already out of view.  </p>
<p>We all chatted about it for the next hour, with a strong sense of joy and excitement.  We all gathered near the south end of the park under some large trees to help shield the rain.  An hour  later, as we were talking and sharing feelings about the President driving by, the motorcade made another pass.  This time going in the opposite direction, heading back towards the White House, down the very same one-way street.  </p>
<p>This time I continued to sit under the trees, not rushing to the street like most of the other protesters who were still there did.  It was a very satisfying feeling to know that we might have actually brought some direct awareness to the leader of the free world.  To me it really felt like we had a voice, and our voice was heard.  Even if it was only for a few passing seconds. </p>
<p>It was quite surreal for me to see the President, to be standing a mere 20 feet from him, even if it was just for a second.  The White House was just two blocks away and he drove past us en route to and from his speech at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner tonight.  Hell, he might not have even known about the protest.  But I know for a fact that he saw us and we saw him.  This is just the start of citizens making their voices heard.  In time, he will know who we are and what we are trying to do.  But for now,  I&#8217;m satisfied in knowing that his motorcade drove past our protest.</p>

			<p>DC is the closest place to us holding a protest.  I wish I could be there.  Don&#8217;t know if we can make it, but please tell the world that neither the Earth&#8217;s people nor the rest of nature, will be chess pieces on the global corporate chessboard any more.  We are not playthings.  We are not sheep.  You cannot herd us like commodities.  We have souls, hearts and intelligent minds, and unlike in the 60s we have the internet.  Sex drugs and rock and roll are not our objectives anymore.  Society has been there and done that already.  Now all we want is simple justice for each of us, common people, the 99% of us.  And an end to the destruction, cruelty, inhumanity, war, pain, suffering, negativity, poverty and inequality that has been perpetrated not just on Americans, but on the entire world by the 1%.  Love, peace and harmony.  This is no hippie thing.  This is in every sacred script of every major religion.</p>

			<p>I am a 29 year old white female and I have a BS degree in International Business.  Nowhere in my degree requirements, ANYWHERE, was I required to take a class in Ethics.  Nor was it ever mentioned.  Wake up people. Neither capitalism, nor communism, nor any -ism whatsoever will ever be fair to the majority when the majority becomes complacent and allows the rich to take over their lives, to live their lives by the proxy of rich people who only want use and abuse them like commodities, for their own immediate-gratification profit motive.  Please read the book The Sociopath Next Door to understand who the 1% are, and an essay called The Idea of A Local Economy by Wendell Berry, to understand what we can do extricate ourselves from their claws.</p>

			<p>I have to disagree.  The real power that is driving the country and the world to hell in a handbasket, makes its lair on Wall Street, not in DC.  That&#8217;s why the movement started there.  But DC is a very important occupation as well, right up there with Wall Street, because of what DC symbolizes to people not just in America but also the whole world.  The White House is there.  The President works out of there.  Planet Earth is watching.  Make it count.  Speak the truth.  Freedom, justice, equality, end of corporate oppression.  It rings true everywhere, not just in America.</p>
